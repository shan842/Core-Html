    <h1>Full Stack Web Development Tech Stack</h1>

    <dl>
        <!-- Frontend -->
        <dt>Frontend</dt>
        <dd>The part of the application that users interact with directly. It includes everything that users experience visually on the web page, such as layout, design, and user interface elements.</dd>

        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>The standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages. HTML defines the content of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.</dd>

        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>A styling language used to describe the appearance of a web page, including layout, colors, fonts, and other visual elements.</dd>

        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>A programming language that enables dynamic interactions on the web. Itâ€™s used for client-side scripting to add interactivity to websites (e.g., form validation, animations, etc.).</dd>

        <dt>React</dt>
        <dd>A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React helps developers create interactive and reusable UI components in a declarative way.</dd>

        <!-- Backend -->
        <dt>Backend</dt>
        <dd>The server-side part of a web application that handles business logic, databases, and user authentication. It processes requests, interacts with the database, and sends data to the frontend.</dd>

        <dt>Node.js</dt>
        <dd>A JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript on the server-side. Node.js is used for building scalable and high-performance backend applications.</dd>

        <dt>Express.js</dt>
        <dd>A web application framework for Node.js. Express simplifies the process of building and managing server-side routing, middleware, and HTTP requests.</dd>

        <dt>Python</dt>
        <dd>A high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is often used in web development, especially with frameworks like Django and Flask.</dd>

        <dt>Django</dt>
        <dd>A high-level Python framework that enables rapid development of web applications. It follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, offering many built-in tools and features for web developers.</dd>

        <dt>Ruby on Rails</dt>
        <dd>A web application framework written in Ruby. Rails emphasizes convention over configuration, making it easier and faster to build web applications.</dd>

        <!-- Database -->
        <dt>Database</dt>
        <dd>The component responsible for storing and managing the data of an application. Databases are essential for persistent data storage in web applications.</dd>

        <dt>MongoDB</dt>
        <dd>A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. MongoDB is often used in modern web applications for scalability and flexibility.</dd>

        <dt>MySQL</dt>
        <dd>A relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses structured query language (SQL) to manage and manipulate structured data.</dd>

        <dt>PostgreSQL</dt>
        <dd>An open-source relational database system known for its robustness, scalability, and support for complex queries.</dd>

        <!-- DevOps & Deployment -->
        <dt>Git</dt>
        <dd>A version control system that tracks changes in the source code during development. Git helps developers collaborate efficiently and manage different versions of the project.</dd>

        <dt>Docker</dt>
        <dd>A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. Docker ensures that applications run consistently across different environments.</dd>

        <dt>Heroku</dt>
        <dd>A cloud platform for deploying and managing applications. It simplifies the process of deploying, scaling, and monitoring web applications in the cloud.</dd>

        <dt>AWS</dt>
        <dd>Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a range of cloud-based services such as storage, databases, computing power, and deployment tools for hosting and managing web applications.</dd>

Explanation of the Code:
1. <dl>: This defines the entire description list that holds the terms and descriptions.
2. <dt>: Represents the term (in this case, the name of a technology or tool in the tech stack).
3. <dd>: Represents the description of the term (providing an explanation of what the technology or tool is used for).


Tech Stack Breakdown:
1. Frontend: Technologies that define how a website looks and interacts with the user, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.
2. Backend: The server-side part of the application that handles business logic, data processing, and database interactions, with technologies like Node.js, Express.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails.
3. Database: Technologies like MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are used to store and manage application data.
4. DevOps & Deployment: Tools like Git for version control, Docker for containerization, and platforms like AWS and Heroku for deploying and scaling applications.
